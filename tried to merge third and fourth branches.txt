Tried to check if third and fourth lines in the first file would just coexist, but a conflict appeared with these results:

contents of first commit, first branch

<<<<<<< HEAD
adding this line to look if  there will be a conflict after merging
=======

again add something to the end
>>>>>>> fourthBranch
